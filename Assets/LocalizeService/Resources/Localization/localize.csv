text2,"You have entered into the small extension that RCA had commissioned in the mid 1930s from Montreal;s architectural firm Ross and MacDonald. The architects were in high demand, many buildings in Montreal carry their signature. Look at the smooth column heads. Nowhere else in the building will you see this level of care taken in the appearance.","Aussi je besoin d;une tradution"
text3,"When the building opened in 1936, the management and administration moved from the older complex along Lacasse and St. Antoine Street to here. The floorplan has cangened, resulting that you now can walk barrierfree from the cloakrooms, at the bottom of the stairs, through the showroom, crossing the advertisement department and ending up, where the secretary of the president had her or his desk. A private stair case, which starts today on the second floor, allowed the president to enter and exit the building relatively unobserved. How convenient.","Une autre place de mettre du contenu"
text4,"Look at the wall around the passenger elevator. You see the shadow of a much larger frame. We do not know why originally two freight elevators were here side by side. The old passenger elevator is still in place behind the door to the staircase. Have a look. Did you try to push the butten to call the elevator here? Well, good luck!","pas encore traduit"
